Redish begins her text saying that "every use of your web site or mobile app is a conversation started by your site visitor" (p.2), it means that when we go on a website and app we are on there for a particular reason, or we need an questions answered. Redish use examples like "I bought a book for my daughter, compared prices for a new printer, and skimmed hotel reviews for a trip..." (p.2). Basically she is saying when we search things up and use certain website and apps we are having a conversation, and the websites in a way are communicating back to us by giving the details and information that we need.As a student I use blackboard, the way it converses with me is giving me notifications when my grades are being put in or even when there is something important my teacher wants me to know. The purpose of blackboard is to be able to see how well we are doing in classes, and gives the audience (students) a easier way to have everything we need for our classes in one place. Another way it converses with me is if the teachers have assignments in blackboard it will color-coat them and put it in a calender. Another app I use is Twitter, the way it converses is by giving notifications when someone likes or retweets a tweet, it also has a explore page which gives us a choices between sports, entertainment, and news (even though I wouldn't recommend twitter for a prime news site). This extra detail provides us with being able to "skim and scan" (p.4), the posts and feel like we've actually read something. The purpose and audience of Twitter can be very different for different people. For example, on Twitter I use it as a way to have conversations with the people on my feed (and vise versa), and I like to see what people are think about certain things, since a lot of people share their whole life story on there. Some people use it for political aspects, following all the news stations and anyone political, so that person's purpose of the website/app is different from mine. Establishing a conversation with the audience is so important in web writing, because in this period of time users are looking for fast and quick explanations or information that is straight to the point. Without having that conversation with the audience, they wouldn't return to the site. Basically it needs to be interactive. In "Now I get it", Ammer says that "interactive means that there are ways to engage with the processes that are happening". There are different ways to make the websites interactive, but it is still have a conversation and still engaging the attention it wants.
